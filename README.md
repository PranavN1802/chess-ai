# Chess Engine

A basic chess engine using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Designed to learn chess engine implementation.

## Features
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Piece-square table evaluation
- Checkmate and stalemate detection
- User input for Black's moves

## Future Plans

- Implement **Beam Search** for more efficient move exploration.
- Experiment with **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for better move decisions.
- Integrate **Transposition Tables** to avoid recalculating positions.
- Test and improve **evaluation functions** for more accurate assessments.
- Implement **opening book** for more intelligent gameplay.
- Add **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for improved user experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `python-chess`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install python-chess
